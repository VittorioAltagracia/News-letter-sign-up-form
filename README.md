# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message

Challenge completed with the use of vanilla JS, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.

I ended up creating my own Checkmark icons with css, by the time I noticed they are included, I had already spent lots of time on this challenge. I wish had noticed them when I needed them.
